changes: 
  - code_imp: "Acid spray cone code no longer uses sleep."
  - refactor: "Cone spray use recursive code, which mean blocking the middle row will not block the other part of the cone. In short, collisions are more consistent"
  - rscadd: "Praetorian can spray diagonally"
  - bugfix: "You can no longer avoid acid spray by running towards the caster. Works for boiler, prae and spitter"
