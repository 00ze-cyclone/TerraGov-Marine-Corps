changes: 
  - balance: "Bipods can be deployed anywhere (after a second-long delay), granting bonuses while deployed. It will auto-retract once the user moves, or drops or equips the weapon."
  - balance: "Scatter reworked to be a bit more organic. Instead of a random adjacent tile it will take into account the pixel clicked on the tile and the shooting direction. The bullet can deviate several tiles (on edge cases, such as untrained dual-wielding on burst, even up to 4 or more)."
  - balance: "Suppressors, extended barrels, stocks, grips and recoil compensators provide a little better effect against scatter. Quickfire and barrel chargers a bit worse."
