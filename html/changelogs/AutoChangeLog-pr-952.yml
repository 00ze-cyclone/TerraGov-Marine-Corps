changes: 
  - balance: "The Queen's Larval Advancement skill cooldown reduced from 60 to 15 seconds. Don't get caught near a queen."
  - balance: "Defiling ability changed. It no longer injects neurotoxin after implanting a larva, only growth serum, besides causing minor brute damage to the chest and decent pain damage to the victim. In compensation the Defiler gains both neuro and larval advancement serum stings. More versatility, less raw power."
  - tweak: "Xeno stings inform the user if their victim is ODing to reduce accidental kills. They will start jittering earlier as well."
  - balance: "Larval growth serum and neurotoxin injection abilities inject 10 and 15u respectively, three times, the first one instant. ODs for them tweaked: soft OD (between 30 and 50u) has low lethality while hard ODs (over 50) is almost certain death. Damage is oxygen, though, so it's easily countered by medics."
