changes: 
  - tweak: "Hyperzine made decent. Now provides a speed bonus that scales with the amount of Hyperzine you have in your blood. Hyperzine causes you to lose nutrition in proportion. When all Hyperzine is metabolized, you then take oxy and halloss damage in proportion to the length of time it's been in your system. This can be fatal. Hyperzine still causes heart damage on ODs, and randomly. OD remains 6, crit OD remains 10"
  - tweak: "Ultrazine speed boost nerfed."
