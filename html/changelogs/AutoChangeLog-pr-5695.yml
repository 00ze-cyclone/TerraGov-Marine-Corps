changes: 
  - balance: "Base Stamina damage dealt by neurospit reduced to 30/35/40. Neurospit now transfers neurotoxin to the target which is reduced by bio armor."
  - balance: "Neurospit now spawns a small area of weak neuro gas; strength of neurogas scales with the user's upgrade level. Praetorian neurospit gas area is larger."
  - balance: "Boiler neurogas extinguishes fire and burning mobs."
  - balance: "Neuro no longer overdoses, and it now deals oxy and toxin damage instead of stamina damage while its victim's stamina is fully depleted."
  - balance: "Neuroglobs now deal 50 stamina damage on hit with 40 pen, standardizing their damage/pen with acid globs."
  - balance: "Neuroglobs now transfer 30U Neurotoxin on hit subject to chest bio armor."
  - balance: "Neuroglobs now stun only for 0.5 seconds down from 2.1 seconds."
  - refactor: "Gas strength calculations refactored to utilize multipliers. Adjusted gas strengths as needed.
tweak: Puking now only slows and staggers for about 5 seconds instead of stunning for 10.
tweak: Having Stamina depleted now only briefly stuns and slows and staggers once every 10 seconds instead of stunning for 8 seconds each time Stamina damage is taken while Stamina is depleted.
tweak: Neuro no longer applies drugginess until its effect has progressed, making this more obvious."
