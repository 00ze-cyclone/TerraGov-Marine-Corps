changes: 
  - rscadd: "T-90 SMG added. A new T-19 sprite."
  - rscdel: "T-19 Holster shouldn't be aquireable from anywhere from req. It's pointless."
  - tweak: "Stuff that used to drop T-19s now drops T-90s. Please tell me if anything saying it should be a T-19 drops a T-90."
  - balance: "Adds the T-90 smg and rebalances the T-14 to be more of a machinepistol style weapon. Check 4079 for changes on github. Main changes are the addition of the new smg and the T-19 is made to be more useable one-handed. Though you might need the stock to make it your primary."
