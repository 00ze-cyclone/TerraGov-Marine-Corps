changes:
  - balance: "Resisting intoxication takes 5 seconds instead of 3 seconds and removes 8 stacks instead of 3 stacks. This makes it 1.6 times more effective in general, but harder to use in the middle of combat."
  - qol: "Resisting intoxication now automatically repeats itself, similarly to repairing things."
  - bugfix: "You can't stack intoxication resists anymore to remove it almost instantly."
