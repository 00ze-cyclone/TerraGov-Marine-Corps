changes:
  - refactor: "The \"gender\" preference has been split into \"gender\" (determines voiced sound effects and pronouns in messages) and \"physique\" (determines sprite and underwear appearance)"
  - bugfix: "as a result of the above neuter and plural characters will have their underwear again, and will default to male options if physique is not set"
