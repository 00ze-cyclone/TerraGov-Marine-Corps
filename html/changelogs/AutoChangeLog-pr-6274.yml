  - bugfix: "Banish now physically teleports things to Brazil, thus addressing corner case issues with things like CAS flares and explosives."
  - balance: "Banish cooldown reduced when used on friendly targets/self by 40% from 20 seconds to 12 seconds, allowing it to be more readily used defensively."
