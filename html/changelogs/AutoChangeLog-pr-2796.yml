changes: 
  - rscadd: "Girders reworked. Wall construction formula tweaked. Marines can build reinforced walls now."
  - tweak: "Structure hitchance tweaked. The direction they are facing matters once again (barricades, flipped tables). Even unflipped tables and window frames have a chance, though lower, to stop bullets. Accuracy modifiers, distance between shooter and obstacle, and effective accuracy range of the bullet all affect it."
  - bugfix: "Windoors no longer block lasers."
  - rscadd: "You can now repair beat-up barricades you couldn't before by adding two sheets of metal/plasteel to them and then welding them."
