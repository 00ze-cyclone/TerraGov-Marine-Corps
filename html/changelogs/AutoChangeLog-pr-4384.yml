  - rscadd: "Added the TL-84 and M-22 marine welderkit backpack."
  - rscdel: "Removed any trace of the M240-T I could find and replaced it with the TL-84. Removed green/blue flame cans from req."
  - balance: "Added the TL-84 to marine vendors, a PFC available flamethrower. It has a fire extinguisher on it. And added the M-22 marine welderbackpack thing to there aswell, no storage. But it refills welders and flamers. The TL-84 can use Blue/Green flame cans so the M240-T is now obsolete so it has been removed, the blue/green flame canisters however have been removed. And are admin only.
