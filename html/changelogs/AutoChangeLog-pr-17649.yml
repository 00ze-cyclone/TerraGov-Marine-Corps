changes:
  - rscadd: "XvH Mechs have been permanently reenabled. One slot will be granted every 20 players, starting at 40 players."
  - rscadd: "Mechs have been reworked to be faster compared to humans, but less tanky (sort of a diver/flanker role)"
  - balance: "Mechs no longer have directional armor, and are more mobile (diagonal movement, spinning to fire)"
  - rscadd: "Mechs have been resprited and repaletted and will update their sprite on boosting or being destroyed, and they will leave a wreck"
  - qol: "Mechs also have many new visual effects"
  - rscadd: "Mech weapons are now split into back and hand weapons, and they can switch between them quickly"
  - rscadd: "Mechs now have a limb mechanic. Aiming arms (weakest limb, breaks in only a few slashes) will disable the weapon on that limb, aiming the head will disable it's NV, aiming legs will increasingly slow it down with damage taken until  it's movement speed is halved at 0 HP. Slashing torso or an already destroyed limb damages the actual mechs HP"
  - balance: "crusher charges will always aim legs, which they will oneshot if they manage to hit them"
  - balance: "All mech weapons and (new) modules have been rebalanced and remade from scratch"
  - rscadd: "Mech now has a dash it can activate by double tapping into a direction, which consumes energy"
  - qol: "The mech Builder UI has been revamped"
  - balance: "Only one mech can be spawned per person at the mech builder. Spatial agents (the admin debug job) are exempt"
