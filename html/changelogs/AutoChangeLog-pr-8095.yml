  - balance: "Wall rework, max HP lowered, they've been given armor against bullets/lasers so their TTK is about the same, they're less effective against fire, high armor piercing weapons, explosions are about the same, but fire is much worse at killing walls quickly, but it still kills a lot of walls at the same time."
