changes: 
  - rscadd: "Hive Leaders (Queens, Shrikes and designated leader xenos) gain the Rally Hive ability, which sends a message to the hive to rally at a target point."
  - rscadd: "The Hive is alerted when a Resin Silo takes damage or a member of the hive takes damage while at less than 33% of its maximum hit points or 100 HP, whichever's higher, giving that member's name, current and max health, current area and coordinates. These alerts can be toggled on or off via preferences per the Aliens tab."
  - tweak: "Resin Silos regenerate 50 HP per slowtick (10 / sec) upon taking damage until they're at maximum HP again."
