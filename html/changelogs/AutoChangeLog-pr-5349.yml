changes: 
  - rscadd: "Healing Infusion ability replaces Acidic Salve for the Hivelord. This is a short-range heal over time that trades spike healing, immunity to fire interruption and independence from weeds for power. Recovery pheromones improve its HP and Sunder recovery by 10% per rank."
  - refactor: "Sunder recovery refactored."
  - tweak: "Baseline Sunder recovery halved."
  - tweak: "Sunder recovery now doubled by weeds and resting, and increased by 10% per rank of recovery pheromones."
  - tweak: "Sunder recovery now blocked by being on fire."
