  - balance: "probability of each ERT depends on the state of the game. IE, if xenos are losing shipside there is more chance than an XRT is called rather than a PMC one"
  - balance: "Each ERT can be called only once (unless admin interaction)"
  - admin: "Admin can deny an ERT without annoncing if they want. They can then use distress beacon verb to send another ERT if they wish to"
