  - rscadd: "Spawning pools. They can be placed by queen/shrike/hivelord, and each one will generate 0.65 larva points every minute. You need 8 points for a new larva, and the larva generation only start when shutters drop. They mature: their larva output will double in 1h30, and then cap at 1.3 larva point a minute"
  - rscadd: "Psychic points. Queen and shrike can corrupt generators (10 in each map), marines can remove that corruption using a welder"
  - rscadd: "Spawning pools can be constructed using psych points (900 points, wich corresponds to 30 minutes with 10 generators).
You are given points to build pools at starts, depending on the number of players on the server. You can't build them next to each other
Special pool can be built when hijack, the spawn rate of this upgraded pool is linear with the number of marines alive. Psych points are reset to 900 when hijacking, so you only get one and the other are destroyed when launching alamo"
  - balance: "Marines have a new objective: if they kill all the pools, xenos have ten minutes to build another one or they lose."
  - rscdel: "Headbiting is gone"
  - rscdel: "Voring is gone"
  - rscdel: "Silos are gone, you can't silo bodies to gain larva
tweak: Passive larva generation when marines are joining the game only works when shutters are closed, after that spawning pools are starting
tweak: Xenos can't grab dead humans anymore, only living ones
tweak: Crit delay is back, 2 seconds"
  - imageadd: "Spawning pool sprite, stole from cimex sprite"
