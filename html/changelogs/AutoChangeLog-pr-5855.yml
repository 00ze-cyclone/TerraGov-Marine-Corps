  - balance: "Reagent slash now acts as a buff, causing the next 3 slashes made over 4 seconds to inject 4U of the user's selected toxin, and 4U of larval growth toxin."
  - balance: "Larval growth toxin no longer has pain killing benefits."
  - code_imp: "Infrastructure added and utilized so Reagent Slash doesn't break if active while upgrading; can also be tapped by other abilities to make them robust vs upgrading.
tweak: Statistics tracking added for Reagent Slashes."
